# 🚦 Turtle Car Crossing Game

Help the turtle safely cross a busy road filled with fast-moving cars! 🐢

This game is built using **Python** and the built-in **`turtle`** graphics module for visuals, along with the **`time`** module for controlling car speed and movement. The game is structured using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with custom classes for the player, cars, scoreboard, and road border.

Each time the turtle successfully reaches the top of the screen, the game **automatically advances to the next level**, and the **cars move faster** to increase the challenge!
